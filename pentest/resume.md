<!-- summary -->
I am 20+ year IT industry veteran with a diverse skill set ranging across multiple technology and security domains. I enjoy continuously testing various skills and learning techniques on sites like HackTheBox and TryHackMe. Frequently learning and growing on my home lab deploying automated VMs and containers while trying new ideas and growing skills with new tools and technologies. Cleared to Special Programs with TS/SCI and a "Security First" mindset since I achieved my CISSP in 2009 with CPE hours already accepted through 2024.
